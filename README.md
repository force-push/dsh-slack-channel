# dsh-slack-channel

A Slack **channel** for [DeepSeek Harness](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness) (DSH): point a Slack bot at a DSH runtime and drive the agent from any Slack channel or DM. One live agent session per channel, replies posted back in-thread.

Pure `fetch` + the platform `WebSocket` — no npm dependencies, no build step, Node ≥ 22. **Socket Mode needs no public URL** — the bot holds an outbound websocket, so it works behind NAT/firewalls.

## What it does

| Slack side | DSH side |
|---|---|
| message event (channels, groups, DMs) | `createTextUserMessage` → `agent.followup()` — the same in-process seam the [ACP bridge](../../code/deepseek-harness/packages/acp/acp) uses |
| committed assistant text | collected per turn from `session/event` (`assistant/message`), posted on `turn/end` via `chat.postMessage` |
| /stop command | `agent.cancel({ kind: 'user' })` + queue clear |
| /new command | dispose the channel's agent, start a fresh session |
| reaction ack | ⏳ reaction while the turn runs, removed when the reply lands |
| errors | `agent/error` quoted back to the channel |

Sessions are created through `ctx.agents` (`inject: ['agents']`), so each channel gets a real DSH session with its own history, tools, and model route. The bot's own messages come back as events (`bot_id`) and edits/deletes carry a `subtype` — both are skipped, so the agent never reacts to itself.

## Requirements

- Node ≥ 22 (platform `fetch` + `WebSocket`)
- A DSH runtime composition that provides the `agents` service (any agent-loop-bearing composition — the default web/headless profiles qualify)
- A Slack workspace where you can install apps
- **Slack-side setup** — see the next section; budget ~10 minutes

## Slack app setup (10 minutes)

Create the app at [api.slack.com/apps](https://api.slack.com/apps) → *Create New App* → *From scratch* → name it (e.g. `deepseeker`), pick your workspace. Then four stops in the app's settings:

### 1. App-level token (`xapp-…`) — *Basic Information* page

Scroll to **App-Level Tokens** → **Generate Token and Scopes**:

- Name: `socket` (anything)
- Scope to add: **`connections:write`**

**Generate** and copy — this token is shown only once. It authenticates the Socket Mode websocket and nothing else.

> ⚠️ Don't confuse this page's other credentials with what the plugin needs: the **Client Secret**, **Signing Secret**, and deprecated **Verification Token** belong to the HTTP-webhook/OAuth install flows, which this plugin never touches. You can leave them untouched (or regenerate them — it changes nothing here).

### 2. Bot token scopes + install (`xoxb-…`) — *OAuth & Permissions* page

Scroll to **Scopes** → *Bot Token Scopes* → **Add an OAuth Scope** for each:

| Scope | Why |
|---|---|
| `chat:write` | post replies |
| `channels:history` | read messages in public channels |
| `groups:history` | read messages in private channels |
| `im:history` | read DMs |
| `reactions:write` | the ⏳ working reaction |
| `reactions:read` | remove it when done |

Then scroll up that page → **Install to Workspace** → **Allow** → copy the **Bot User OAuth Token** (`xoxb-…`). Adding scopes later requires clicking *Reinstall* — do that whenever you change scopes.

### 3. Socket Mode — *Socket Mode* page

Toggle **On**. (This is what the `xapp-` token is for; without it the plugin can't connect — and you never need a public URL or TLS.)

### 4. Event subscriptions — *Event Subscriptions* page

Toggle **Enable Events** → *Subscribe to bot events* → add exactly:

- `message.channels` (public channels)
- `message.groups` (private channels)
- `message.im` (DMs)

**Save Changes**.

> ⚠️ Do **not** subscribe `app_mention` — Slack would deliver both the mention and the underlying message, and the agent would answer twice.

### 5. Invite the bot and grab a channel id

In Slack: `/invite @yourbot` in the channel you want served (DMs need no invite — find the bot under **Apps** in your sidebar).

Get the channel id either way:

- Post `/id` in the channel once the plugin is running — the bot replies with the id, or
- Slack UI: channel name → *About* tab → **Channel ID** (starts `C` public / `G` private / `D` DM)

### Which Slack credentials matter — summary

| Credential | Page | Used by the plugin |
|---|---|---|
| **App-Level Token** (`xapp-`) | Basic Information → App-Level Tokens | ✅ Socket Mode connection |
| **Bot User OAuth Token** (`xoxb-`) | OAuth & Permissions (after install) | ✅ all Web API calls |
| Client ID / Client Secret | Basic Information | ❌ (OAuth install flow only) |
| Signing Secret | Basic Information | ❌ (HTTP webhook verification only) |
| Verification Token | Basic Information | ❌ (deprecated) |

## Configure the plugin

Keep both tokens out of the repo — the overlay reads them from the environment:

```yaml
- insert:
    - id: slack-channel
      name: dsh-slack-channel            # or the absolute path to src/index.js
      inject: [agents]
      config:
        botToken: !!js process.env.SLACK_BOT_TOKEN
        appToken: !!js process.env.SLACK_APP_TOKEN
        # Target channels: Slack channel ids from /id (C…/G…/D…).
        allowedChannelIds: ['C0123456789']
```

The shipped [`cordis.patch.yml`](cordis.patch.yml) is exactly this, with every knob documented — mount it directly:

```sh
SLACK_BOT_TOKEN=xoxb-… SLACK_APP_TOKEN=xapp-… \
  pnpm dsh web --patch /path/to/dsh-slack-channel/cordis.patch.yml
```

For a **headless runtime** (no GUI — the whole agent lives behind Slack), boot the headless profile the same way and keep the process running:

```sh
SLACK_BOT_TOKEN=xoxb-… SLACK_APP_TOKEN=xapp-… \
  pnpm dsh --profile headless --patch /path/to/dsh-slack-channel/cordis.patch.yml
```

Prefer not to restart on config changes? Set `pairToken` + `stateFile` once, then enroll channels from Slack itself with `/pair <token>` — no host restart, enrollments persist.

## Channel commands

| Command | Effect |
|---|---|
| /new | dispose the channel's session and start a fresh one |
| /stop | cancel the running turn and clear the queue |
| /id | reply with the channel id (for `allowedChannelIds`) |
| /pair <token> | enroll this channel when `pairToken` is configured |
| /help, /start | command summary |

Anything else goes to the agent as a user message. Messages posted while the agent is busy are queued per channel and drained in order (with a configurable ack). Replies post in-thread when `threadReplies` is on.

## Using Slack as a remote DSH interface

Every Slack conversation the bot is in gets its own independent DSH session. Three shapes:

| Shape | How | Best for |
|---|---|---|
| **DM the bot** | find it under **Apps** in your Slack sidebar | a private remote DSH terminal — no invite, no id discovery |
| **A dedicated channel** | `/invite @yourbot` | a shared workspace thread; everyone sees the agent's work |
| **Many channels** | `/invite @yourbot` in each | separating projects — each channel keeps its own session |

Slack never auto-joins bots to channels — `/invite` per channel (or just use the DM, which needs nothing). Serving *every* channel the bot is a member of without listing ids is `allowAllChannels: true` — weigh that against everyone in the workspace being able to drive the agent.

**Sections ↔ workspaces.** A Slack sidebar section is the natural image of a DSH
workspace: file one channel per project into a section named for it, and pin
each channel's workspace with `channelCwd` (falling back to `cwd`). Sections
are client-side organization — Slack ships no bot API to create or read them —
so the mapping is agreed on both ends: you group the channels in Slack, the
config pins each channel's workspace here. Every channel remains one
independent session (`/new` starts a fresh one) rooted in that workspace,
carrying the same route, permission preset, and persistence as the web
interface.

## Full configuration reference

| Key | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `botToken` | `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN` env | Bot token (`xoxb-`) for the Web API. |
| `appToken` | `SLACK_APP_TOKEN` env | App-level token (`xapp-`) for Socket Mode. |
| `apiBase` | `https://slack.com/api` | Web API base; point at a mock for tests. |
| `provider` / `model` | host default | Agent route for created sessions. |
| `cwd` | server cwd | Workspace root for created sessions (must be absolute). |
| `channelCwd` | — | Per-channel workspace override: `{ "C…": "/abs/path" }`. Lets a Slack sidebar section (channels grouped per project) agree with DSH workspaces. |
| `permissionPreset` | composition default | Named preset applied to each freshly created session — the same table the web UI's preset switcher offers (`workspace-write`, `danger-full-access`, …). Resumed sessions keep their existing knobs. |
| `allowedChannelIds` | `[]` | Channel allowlist. Empty + `allowAllChannels: false` denies everything. |
| `allowAllChannels` | `false` | Explicitly serve every channel the bot is in. |
| `notifyUnauthorized` | `false` | Reply "not authorized" to rejected channels. |
| `stateFile` | — | JSON file persisting channel → session ids and /pair enrollments. |
| `pairToken` | — | Enables the enrollment flow (requires `stateFile`). |
| `replyMode` | `last` | `last`: final assistant message of a turn; `all`: join every assistant message. |
| `maxReplyChars` | `4000` | Split longer replies at line boundaries. |
| `threadReplies` | `true` | Reply in-thread on the originating message. |
| `ackReaction` | `hourglass` | Emoji reaction marking the message being worked on (empty string disables). |
| `retryDelayMs` | `3000` | Backoff after Web API failures. |
| `socketRetryDelayMs` | `2000` | Backoff between Socket Mode reconnects. |

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `invalid_auth` at connect | tokens swapped, or app token from the wrong page | `xapp-` = Socket Mode (App-Level Tokens), `xoxb-` = Web API (OAuth & Permissions); the plugin logs which one failed |
| `missing_scope` on Web API calls | bot scopes missing or added after install | add the scopes, then click **Reinstall to Workspace** |
| Connects, but posting a message does nothing | channel not in `allowedChannelIds` | the authorization gate runs before commands — add the channel id to the config, use `/pair`, or set `allowAllChannels: true` |
| Connects, but nothing at all arrives | event subscriptions missing | *Event Subscriptions* → `message.channels` / `message.groups` / `message.im`, Save |
| Reply lands but no ⏳ reaction | `reactions:write` scope missing | add the scopes, reinstall |
| Two replies per message | `app_mention` subscribed alongside `message.channels` | remove `app_mention` from the event subscriptions |
| Socket Mode connects, then drops periodically | expected | Slack recycles connections; the plugin reconnects automatically with a fresh URL |

## Security

A bot token is a **credential**: whoever can post into a served channel can drive a full agent — with shell tools if the composition mounts them. The plugin denies every channel by default. Practical posture:

1. Post `/id` in the target channel; put the channel id in `allowedChannelIds`.
2. Prefer private channels/groups; in public channels every member can drive the agent.
3. Never set `allowAllChannels: true` on a bot installed workspace-wide.
4. Restrict the composition the channel mounts into — don't give the Slack-facing host approval-free shell access unless you accept the risk.
5. For enrollment without config edits, set `pairToken` (+ `stateFile`) and `/pair <token>` from the target channel. Enrollment is additive; remove ids from `state.json` to revoke.

## Testing

```sh
node tests/run.mjs
```

52 tests, no network required: the suite drives the plugin's `apply` against a local mock Web API server and a scripted fake websocket — reply delivery (threaded), reaction acks, echo guard, queueing, /new, /stop, /pair enrollment persistence, unauthorized gating, teardown, Socket Mode ack/reconnect/abort behavior, config validation, mrkdwn escaping, chunk splitting, and the Web API client (error mapping, 429 Retry-After header).

There is also a live smoke test without an LLM: `node smoke.mjs` mounts the plugin with a stub echo agent against your real workspace (tokens from `.env.local`, gitignored) — post a message, get `echo: <text>` in-thread.

## Known limitations

- **Text only** — attachments, blocks, and mentions in the incoming message are ignored (only `text` is forwarded); replies are mrkdwn text.
- **Socket Mode only** — no Events API webhook mode; the plugin holds a websocket in-process.
- **No slash-command integration** — commands are plain chat text ("/new"); Slack's interactivity/slash-command payloads are acked and ignored.
- **One turn per channel at a time** — concurrent messages queue; they are not steering.
- **Approval questions** are not surfaced on Slack; mount this plugin in a composition whose policy does not require interactive approval.
